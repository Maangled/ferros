# S2 Profile & Identity — Contracts

---

## Contracts owned by S2

These are the cross-stream interfaces that S2 publishes. Other streams **must not** define their own identity or grant types — they consume these.

| Contract | Type | Location | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| `ProfileId` type | Rust type | `crates/ferros-profile/src/lib.rs` | ✅ Created |
| `CapabilityGrant` type | Rust type | `crates/ferros-profile/src/lib.rs` | ✅ Created |
| `ConsentManifest` type | Rust type | `crates/ferros-profile/src/lib.rs` | ✅ Created |
| `schemas/profile.v0.json` | JSON Schema | `schemas/profile.v0.json` | 🟡 Drafted; exercised by `ferros-profile` tests |
| `schemas/capability-grant.v0.json` | JSON Schema | `schemas/capability-grant.v0.json` | ✅ Frozen signed envelope; exercised by `ferros-profile` tests |

## Current repo state

`schemas/profile.v0.json` remains the S2-owned draft freeze candidate referenced by the `ferros-profile` test suite. `schemas/capability-grant.v0.json` now freezes the signed grant envelope contract, `schemas/fixtures/grant-valid.json` anchors the happy path, `schemas/fixtures/grant-invalid-sig.json` anchors invalid-signature rejection, and `SignedCapabilityGrant` preserves the current flattened envelope shape without changing the runtime `CapabilityGrant` or `CapabilityGrantView` consumer boundary.

The grant verification contract is now published in `schemas/capability-grant.v0.json`: independent verifiers must rebuild the signed payload from only `profile_id`, `capability`, and optional `revoked_at` and `revocation_reason`, emit UTF-8 JSON with no insignificant whitespace in exactly that member order, verify the Ed25519 signature with `signer_public_key`, and only then trust the embedded grant fields. `signer_public_key` and `signature` are envelope-only fields and are never part of the signed payload.

| Contract | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Cargo workspace | S1 | Build and CI |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` | S1 | Toolchain pin |

## Schema freeze policy

`profile.v0.json` remains the draft freeze candidate. `capability-grant.v0.json` is now frozen at the stripped-payload signed-envelope contract described above and must not be mutated in place; new grant fields go into a `v1` schema with explicit migration rules. Once `profile.v0.json` is likewise frozen, it must follow the same rule. See `ROADMAP.md` — coordination rules.

## Downstream consumers

| Stream | What it consumes |
|--------|-----------------|
| S3 Agent Center | `ProfileId`, `CapabilityGrant` — agents require a granted profile to spawn |
| S4 Runtime | `CapabilityGrant` — consent bus enforces grants at the policy engine |
| S7 Hub | `ProfileId` — pairing flow creates device-bound profile + issues grants |
